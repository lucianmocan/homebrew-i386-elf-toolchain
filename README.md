### How to compile xv6 x86_32 on macOS ?

1. Install the cross-compiler and qemu : 
```
    brew tap lucianmocan/homebrew-i386-elf-toolchain
    brew install lucianmocan/i386-elf-toolchain/i386-elf-binutils lucianmocan/i386-elf-toolchain/i386-elf-gcc
    brew install qemu
```
2. Open the `Makefile` and uncomment `TOOLPREFIX` after the comment `Cross-compiling (e.g., on Mac OS X)`. Set `TOOLPREFIX=i386-elf-`.
3. Go in the `xv6-public` directory and run `make`.
4. Then `make qemu`.
5. well done!


# i386-elf-toolchain tap

![GCC toolchain for i386]

This tap provides Homebrew formulas to build a suitable compiler for the
i386-elf toolchain, which is useful to build 32 bit freestanding
applications such as kernels using the GNU toolchain.

The formulas in this repo are based in the instructions that at some
point were provided by the [OSDev wiki]. The page has changed in these
years, but as long as the instructions continue working, I will not
probably update the compile flags unless there is some benefit.

I test this tap in macOS and Linux.

## Disclaimer

There is a real formula for GNU GRUB in this repo. The purpose of this
formula is to make easier to install GRUB on a Mac in order to author
ISO files containing kernel images and bootloaders, or virtual hard
drives or IMG files. **BE CAREFUL WITH THIS**, you don't want to
accidentaly wipe your host bootloader with this.

These formulaes are provided here for utility reasons in the hope that
they are useful to people playing with operating systems and kernel
development, but they come with no warranties. I'm not responsible on
whatever you do with these formulaes. Always check the contents of a
formula before installing it.
